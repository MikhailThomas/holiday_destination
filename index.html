  <br>  <b>4. Sight seeing</b><br>You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or you’re yearning for something exciting and different.Learning is a strong reason why people love to travel.  They want to experience something unfamiliar and leave with new skills or knowledge. Seeing the world is more educational than a high school or college class.
    Expanding your perspective, getting in touch with yourself, having an adventure and escaping are some of my oersonal reasons for getting outside of the house and going sight seeing. Places i would love to see in the Bahamas are: <br>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.atlantisbahamas.com/">Atlantis Paradise Island</a><br>
        <a href="https://www.nassauparadiseisland.com/">Nassau</a><br>
        <a href="https://luxuryyachtcharters.com/experiences/">Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <br>  <b>5. Relaxation</b><br>This reason is the most important to as life gets hectic we tend to just roll with the punches and stop making time for our mental and physical health, taking time and relaxing will help you find peace of mind.
